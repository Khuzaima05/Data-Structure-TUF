# üîç Binary Search and Variants

Binary Search is one of the most fundamental algorithms in computer science.  
It is used to efficiently find an element in a **sorted array** in **O(log n)** time.

This repository contains implementations of:

- Recursive Binary Search
- Iterative Binary Search
- Lower Bound (first index where value ‚â• target)
- Upper Bound (first index where value > target)
- Search in Rotated Sorted Array (no duplicates)
- Search in Rotated Sorted Array II (with duplicates)
- Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
- Find Rotation Count in Rotated Sorted Array

## üìñ What is Binary Search?

Binary Search works on **sorted arrays**.  
Instead of scanning every element (like Linear Search), it:

1. Picks the **middle element**.
2. If the middle is the target ‚Üí return it.
3. If the target is smaller ‚Üí search in the **left half**.
4. If the target is larger ‚Üí search in the **right half**.
5. Repeat until found or search space is empty.

## üìå Visualization

Suppose we have the sorted array:

```
Index:  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Array: [1,  2,  4,  4,  4,  5,  7]
```

Target = `4`

### Step-by-step search:

```
low = 0, high = 6
mid = 3 ‚Üí arr[mid] = 4 ‚úÖ Found at index 3
```

---

## üìå Lower Bound & Upper Bound

### ‚úÖ Lower Bound

- First index where value is **greater than or equal to** target.
- Example: For target = `4`
  ```
  Array: [1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 7]
  Lower Bound = index 2  (first 4)
  ```

### ‚úÖ Upper Bound

- First index where value is **strictly greater than** target.
- Example: For target = `4`
  ```
  Array: [1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 7]
  Upper Bound = index 4  (last 4)
  ```

üëâ Using both, we can find the **first and last occurrence** of a target.

## üìå Search in Rotated Sorted Array (No Duplicates)

When a sorted array is rotated (e.g., `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`), binary search still works!

Steps:

1. One half of the array (left or right) is always sorted.
2. Check if target lies in the sorted half.
3. Continue search in that half.

Example:

```
Array:  [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
Target: 0

Step 1: mid=3 ‚Üí arr[mid]=7
Left half [4,5,6,7] is sorted, but 0 not in it ‚Üí search right half.

Step 2: mid=5 ‚Üí arr[mid]=1
Still not match ‚Üí search left half of this region.

Step 3: mid=4 ‚Üí arr[mid]=0 ‚úÖ Found at index 4
```

‚è± Complexity: **O(log n)**

---

## üìå Search in Rotated Sorted Array II (With Duplicates)

This is a variation where the rotated array **may contain duplicates** (e.g., `[2,5,6,0,0,1,2]`).

The challenge:

- If `arr[low] == arr[mid] == arr[high]`, we **cannot decide which side is sorted**.
- In that case, shrink the search space by moving `low++` and `high--`.

Example:

```
Array:  [2, 5, 6, 0, 0, 1, 2]
Target: 0

Step 1: mid=3 ‚Üí arr[mid]=0 ‚úÖ Found
```

‚è± Complexity:

- **Worst Case**: O(n) (when duplicates force shrinking one by one)
- **Best/Average Case**: O(log n)

---

## üìå Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (Without Duplicates)

**Problem:**  
We are given a rotated sorted array **without duplicates** (e.g., `[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`).  
The task is to find the **minimum element**.

---

### ‚ö° Approach

- If `arr[mid] > arr[high]` ‚Üí Minimum lies in the **right half** ‚Üí `low = mid + 1`.
- Else ‚Üí Minimum lies in the **left half (including mid)** ‚Üí `high = mid`.

Example:

```
Array:  [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
Minimum element = 0

Step 1: mid=3 ‚Üí arr[mid]=7, arr[high]=2 ‚Üí arr[mid] > arr[high] ‚Üí move low=mid+1 ‚Üí low=4
Step 2: low=4 ‚Üí arr[low]=0 ‚úÖ Found minimum


Minimum element = 0

```

### ‚è± Complexity

- **Time:** O(log n)
- **Space:** O(1)

## üìå Example Usage

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Function declarations (implementations are in .cpp files)
int binary_iterative(vector<int>& nums, int target);
int lower_bound(vector<int>& v, int x);
int upper_bound(vector<int>& v, int x);
int search(vector<int>& v, int target);         // Rotated (no duplicates)
class Solution; // For Rotated II (with duplicates)

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 7};
    int target = 4;

    cout << "Binary Search (Iterative): " << binary_iterative(nums, target) << endl;
    cout << "Lower Bound: " << lower_bound(nums, target) << endl;
    cout << "Upper Bound: " << upper_bound(nums, target) << endl;

    vector<int> rotated = {4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2};
    cout << "Search in Rotated Array (target=0): " << search(rotated, 0) << endl;

    vector<int> rotatedDup = {2, 5, 6, 0, 0, 1, 2};
    Solution s;
    cout << "Search in Rotated Array II (target=0): " << s.search(rotatedDup, 0) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

‚ú® With binary search, you don‚Äôt check all elements ‚Üí you **divide and conquer** until the target is found (or not found).

```
Every step halves the search space ‚ûù O(log n) time (except worst case with duplicates).
```
