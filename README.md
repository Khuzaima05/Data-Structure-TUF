# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms in C++  

This repository contains **C++ implementations of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
I am following the **Striver’s DSA playlists** from the [takeUforward YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@takeUforward/playlists).  

The goal is to **learn, implement, and practice** all fundamental and advanced DSA concepts in C++.
